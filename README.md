Testofill, the Form Filler for Testers Chrome Extension
=======================================================

Goal: Enable testers to fill forms automatically/on-demand with predefined and/or generated values.
It is possible to define and choose from multiple sets of values for a given form.

State: Automatic/on-demand form filling with predefined values; no value generation or multiple sets yet.

Fields are found using CSS3 selectors (via [Sizzle]()). The configuration of the plugin is a JavaScript object.
Forms are filled either automatically or when you click the plugin icon.

Based on [work by Akkunchoi](http://akkunchoi.github.io/Autofill-chrome-extension).


Example of configuration
------------------------

(Extensions - Testofill - Options)

  forms: {
    "mysite.com/.*/myform": [ // (partial) regular expression or a substring of the form's URL
      {
        name: "Bob the Test Manager",  // (optional) to distinguish multiple sets of values for the same form
        doc: "Register as the test manager Bob", // (optional) displayed next to the name in a popup
        fields: [
          {query: "[name='fname']", value: "Bob"},
          {query: "[name='sname']", value: "Testofill"},
          {query: "[id$='phone']", code: function(){return "+471234567" + Random.nextInt();}}
