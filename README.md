Testofill, the Form Filler for Testers Chrome Extension
=======================================================

Goal: Enable testers to fill forms automatically/on-demand with predefined and/or generated values.
It is possible to define and choose from multiple sets of values for a given form.

State: Automatic/on-demand form filling with predefined values; no value generation or multiple sets yet.

Fields are found using CSS3 selectors (via [Sizzle]()). The configuration of the plugin is a JavaScript object.
Forms are filled either automatically or when you click the plugin icon.

Based on [work by Akkunchoi](http://akkunchoi.github.io/Autofill-chrome-extension).
